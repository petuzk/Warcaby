This repository contains my implementation of the checkers (board game).
It was originally created as a university project.
Currently the game is in Polish, but I'm planning to add other languages.

## Build instructions

To build the project, you can use CMake or just run `make` in root directory.
It will create a `build` directory and compile code creating an executable `draughts`.

## To-Do
- Reimplement UI rendering (in progress)
- Translate UI
- Translate comments in the code
